# General Observations

1. The C# implementation is more idiomatic and easier to read than the C++/CLR version.

2. There's a good separation of concerns between the different classes.

3. The implementation seems to be incomplete, with several key methods throwing NotImplementedException. However this is by design.

# Security Considerations

1. Proper sanitization with script in execute powershell to prevent injection attacks.
2. Injection largely shouldn't work as it should inject into serialized content.

# Performance Considerations

1. The Verbose_DataAdded and Warning_DataAdded methods concatenate strings in a loop. Consider using StringBuilder for better performance with large outputs.
2. The BindEvents method uses reflection, which can be slow. If possible, consider a design that avoids reflection.
