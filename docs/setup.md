This implementation incorporates the ExecutePowerShell method into the C++/CLR PowerShellExecutor class. Here are some key points about this implementation:

1. We've added the ExecutePowerShell method to the class, which takes a `PowerShellExecutionResult*`, a `String^` for the script, and a bool for `isInlinePowershell`.
2. The method is marked with `[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType::U1)]` to match the unsafe C# method.
3. We've added member variables for tracking various counters (`verboseLinesProcessed`, `warningLinesProcessed`, etc.).
4. The implementation follows the structure of the C# code, including error handling, PowerShell initialization, and custom runtime extension loading.
5. We've used `marshal_as` to convert between managed `String^` and native `std::string` where necessary.
6. The `PowerShellExecutionResult struct` is assumed to have Success and Output fields. You may need to adjust this based on your actual structure.
7. We've added a placeholder `DeserializeScriptVariables` method, which you'll need to implement based on your specific deserialization requirements.
8. Error handling and resource cleanup are implemented in a `try-catch-finally` block to ensure proper disposal of resources.

# To use this in your project:

1. Ensure that you have all the necessary headers and libraries linked (`System.Management.Automation`, etc.).
2. You may need to implement or modify some utility classes (`ProcessUtil`, `SettingsService`, `LogUtil`, `StringUtil`) to match your project's structure.
3. Implement the `DeserializeScriptVariables` method according to your specific requirements.
4. Be cautious with memory management, especially when dealing with unmanaged resources like `char*` in `PowerShellExecutionResult`.
5. You might need to adjust some types or method signatures depending on your exact PowerShell and .NET Framework versions.

This implementation provides a foundation for your `PowerShellExecutor` class in C++/CLR, closely mirroring the functionality of your C# code. You can further refine and extend it based on your specific needs and the broader context of your application.
